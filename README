The data contained in output.txt contains the metric entropy of various embeddings at a few fixed radii.
There is a line denoting the algorithm which created the embedding along with some distinguishing features about the embedding.
What you see here is just a few preliminary data points - we have yet to fully implement our various metrics.

These are just preliminary results on individual embeddings - they are not the form our final results are going to take.
As we describe in the document, we will compute the metric entropies of embeddings for radii scaled with respect to the average pairwise distances of the embeddings.

Our output (later) could take the following form: For a particular metric, given an embedding output the distance between the embedding and and a noisy version of itself
for various amounts of noise. Broadly, a specific line of an output file will describe a pair of word embeddings and the distance between them. The output file won't
actually contain the word embeddings - generally the pairs will be generated according to some specific scheme as described above.

See the writeup for a more detailed description of each experiment we are goint to run.
